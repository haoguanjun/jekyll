# Azure & Xamarin Training

## [ADB 框架](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/){_target="_blank"}

We are creating different applications based on different needs. But implementing common and similar structures over and over again, at least in some level. Authorization, Validation, Exception Handling, Logging, Localization, Database Connection Management, Setting Management, Audit Logging are some of these common structures. Also, we are building architectural structures and best practices like Layered and Modular Architecture, Domain Driven Design, Dependency Injection and so on. And trying to develop applications based on some conventions.
Since all of these are very time-consuming and hard to build seperately for every project, many companies create private frameworks. They're developing new applications faster with less bugs using these frameworks. Surely, not all companies that lucky. Most of them have no time, budget and team to develop such frameworks. Even they have possibility to create a framework, it's hard to document, train developers and maintain it.
ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP) is an open source and well documented application framework started idea of "developing a common framework for all companies and all developers!" It's not just a framework but also provides a strong architectural model based on Domain Driven Design and best practices in mind.

## [AutoMapper](http://automapper.org/){_target="_blank"}

AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?

This is the main repository for AutoMapper, but there's more:

* [EF6 Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.EF6)
* [IDataReader/Record Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Data)
* [Collection Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Collection)
* [Microsoft DI Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection)
